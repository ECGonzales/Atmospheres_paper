# Atmospheres_paper
SEDs/ work for Atmospheres paper 

This repo contains the plots and associated code to generate them needed for my atmospheres paper focused on 1256-0224.
These plots started off as part of my NSBP Fall 2016 poster and will be resused in my poster for Women in Astronomy,
Emerging Researchers in Exoplanet Science, and possibly SACNAS.
